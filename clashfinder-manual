Although director Bill Gunn \u2013 riding a wave of blaxploitation bloodsuckers in the early 1970s \u2013 said \u201cthe last thing I want to do is make a black vampire film\u201d, he paved a path for black filmmakers to use genre to say what is unsayable without it. Black anthropologist Dr Hess Green (Duane Jones) is researching the Mythrians, an ancient African nation who ritually drank blood. When he is stabbed with one of their artefacts, a mystic dagger wielded by his deranged assistant Meda (director Bill Gunn), it awakens an unquenchable thirst. When Meda\u2019s wife Ganja (Marlene Clark) searches for her husband, she is converted and learns to live with the demands put on her by her new life.\nLater remade by Spike Lee (Da Sweet Blood of Jesus), Ganja & Hess gave its star Duane Jones another classic horror title to his name, alongside his lead in Night of the Living Dead. Seeing the African American experience as parallel to the vampire\u2019s experience of violent transformation and complex assimilation, Ganja & Hess articulated a conflicted yearning for freedoms beyond the recent Civil Rights struggle. Later recut and released in an inferior version, this restoration represents the original release, restored by The Museum of Modern Art with support from The Film Foundation, and mastered in HD from a 35mm negative.\nPresented as part of the BFI\u2019s In Dreams Are Monsters Tour from the Independent Cinema Office."}

Part drama, part thriller, the story follows Pamfir as he returns to his family after a long absence, ready to celebrate the traditional carnival in their home village the following day. But when his son starts a fire in the prayer house, Pamfir has no other choice but to reconnect with his troubled past. He returns to work for a shady crime syndicate operating a risky smuggling venture, with irreversible consequences.\nThe screenings of Pamfir at LIFF 2022 are part of the\u00a0UK/Ukraine season, a new programme of cultural activity to support the Ukrainian cultural sector, produced by the British Council and Ukrainian Institute. We are also screening Brief Encounters in Official Selection and The Hamlet Syndrome in Cinema Versa.\n\n\n"}
