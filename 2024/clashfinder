Their only collaboration, Chidambaram, tells the story of Shankaran (Gopi), a cowherd whose attraction to his friend\u2019s wife, Shivagami (played by Patil), leads to tragic consequences. Set in the picturesque hill regions of Tamil Nadu, the film explores themes of guilt, redemption and caste hierarchies. Patil's evocative portrayal of Shivagami is full of nuance while Aravindan turns to religious imagery expressly the ancient Nataraja temple in Chidambaram to conjure something tantalisingly supernatural and allegorical. \u00a0\n\"A pensive, profoundly moving cinematic work that diagnosed the moral weight of human nature without calling attention to itself as an overarching statement.\" - An Awadh Boys Panorama\nContains themes of suicide, alcohol abuse and domestic abuse."}

How to Build a Truth Engine assembles a diverse team of contributors from different backgrounds: technology, journalism, folklore and neuroscience. The consensus emerges that if you hack the information feed, you can hack somebody\u2019s mind. We are taken from the information battlefields into the inner workings of the human brain and show how - through us - a web of lies can change reality.\n\"Undeniably powerful and riveting from start to finish, How To Build A Truth Engine is a vital film that presents morally complex issues, showcasing how higher powers can leverage the evolution of modern technology.\" - M.N. Miller, Geek Vibes Nation\n\u00a0"}
